# Architecture Overview

This document will track design decisions and architecture diagrams for the Subway Surfers AI project.

- **Environment**: Interfaces with Android emulator via ADB, captures frames, and sends actions.
- **Agent**: Reinforcement learning algorithms (starting with DQN) implemented in PyTorch.
- **Training**: Scripts and utilities to optimize the agent.
